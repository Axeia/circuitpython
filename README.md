# circuitpython
Just a literal repository for me to dump some scripts that I got working on a Banana Pi Leaf S3 (BPI-Leaf-S3) using circuitpython.
Not really intended to be supported in any way :)

I don't plan on going in depth how I have things wired up etc etc so if you're hoping to replicate what I have done the best thing I can do is to suggest looking at my code and reverse engineering from there.
I did go fairly in depth in the st7789 example as it took me quite some time to get it running.

I'm using:
* [circuitpython 8.2.3](https://circuitpython.org/board/bpi_leaf_s3/)
* [libraries from adafruits library bundle for circuitpython 8.x](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)
* [Banana Pi Leaf S3 (BPI-Leaf-S3)](https://wiki.banana-pi.org/BPI-Leaf-S3)
* [A very cheap 1.47" SPI display from Aliexpress](https://vi.aliexpress.com/item/1005003771379232.html)
